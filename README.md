## Completed "404 Not Found Challenge" from [here](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/wBunSb7FPrIepJZAg0sY)

**Stats:**
- Time: 15m
- Difficulty: 1/5

**How I Did It:**
- Used flexbox for image and text.
- Used a `media` query to make it responsive by changing the `flex-direction` from `row` to `column`.

Used Next.js because I could -.-
